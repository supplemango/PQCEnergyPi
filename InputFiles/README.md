# Input Files

These files are used as Inputs for the **batch_experimenter.py** file which is run on the Raspberry Pi.

They contain the list of algorithms and iteration count for each experiment to be run.

They're in csv format, so please ignore them having a .txt filetype suffix!

e.g. **python ./batch_experimenter.py 10kSourceRSAscaled.txt**
